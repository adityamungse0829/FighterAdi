## 📊 Percentage Calculations

### Weekly Percentage
- **Includes:** All 7 days of the week
- **Formula:** Sum of all 7 days / 7
- **Example:** 
  - Day 1: 83%
  - Day 2: 72%
  - Days 3-7: 0%
  - **Result:** (83+72+0+0+0+0+0) / 7 = **22.1%**

### Monthly Percentage
- **Includes:** All days in the month
- **Formula:** Sum of all days / Total days in month
- **Example:**
  - 10 days with 100%
  - 20 days with 0%
  - **Result:** (1000%) / 30 = **33.3%**

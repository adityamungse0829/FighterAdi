# Fighter App - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Task Checkbox Click Bug (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** When clicking on one daily task, another task's checkbox was getting toggled
**Root Cause:** Widget key was using `hashCode` which changes when task properties change (completed status, completion date)
**Solution:** Changed widget key from `ValueKey(t.hashCode.toString() + t.title)` to `ValueKey(t.id)`
**File:** `lib/screens/tasks_screen.dart` (Line 532)
**Impact:** Tasks now toggle correctly after daily reset

---

### 2. ✅ Weekly Percentage Calculation (IMPORTANT)
**Problem:** Weekly percentage was showing only average of days with tasks
- Example: 2 days with 83% and 72% showed as 78% (average of 2 days)
- Should show: 22.1% (average of all 7 days)

**Root Cause:** Code was only averaging days that had tasks, ignoring empty days
**Solution:** Changed calculation to include all 7 days in the week
**File:** `lib/screens/calendar_screen.dart` (Lines 44-56)
**Formula:** `(Day1% + Day2% + ... + Day7%) / 7`

---

### 3. ✅ Monthly Percentage Calculation (IMPORTANT)
**Problem:** Monthly percentage was showing only average of days with tasks
**Root Cause:** Same as weekly - only averaging days with tasks
**Solution:** Changed calculation to include all days in the month
**File:** `lib/screens/calendar_screen.dart` (Lines 58-72)
**Formula:** `(Day1% + Day2% + ... + DayN%) / TotalDaysInMonth`

---

### 4. ✅ Daily Task Reset (FEATURE)
**Problem:** Daily tasks were not being properly reset for the next day
**Solution:** 
- Daily tasks are now unchecked at midnight
- Completion date is cleared
- Daily goal progress resets to 0 points
**File:** `lib/screens/task_provider.dart` (Lines 119-163)

---

### 5. ✅ Non-Daily Task Deletion (FEATURE)
**Problem:** Non-daily tasks from previous day were not being deleted
**Solution:** 
- Non-daily tasks are now deleted when a new day starts
- Only daily tasks remain for the new day
- Historical data is preserved for calendar/reports
**File:** `lib/screens/task_provider.dart` (Lines 140-150)

---

### 6. ✅ Manual Daily Reset for Testing (FEATURE)
**Problem:** No way to test daily reset without waiting for midnight
**Solution:** 
- Added `manuallyTriggerDailyReset()` method in TaskProvider
- Added "🧪 Trigger Daily Reset (Testing)" button in Settings
- Allows instant testing of daily reset functionality
**Files:** 
- `lib/screens/task_provider.dart` (Lines 262-283)
- `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` (Lines 106-135, 1101-1129)

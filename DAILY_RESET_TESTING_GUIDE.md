# Daily Reset Testing Guide

## Overview
The Fighter app now has a complete daily reset system that:
1. ✅ **Resets daily tasks** - Unchecks all recurring tasks for the new day
2. ✅ **Deletes non-daily tasks** - Removes tasks created for the previous day
3. ✅ **Resets daily goal progress** - Shows 0 points at the start of each day
4. ✅ **Maintains history** - Keeps completed tasks for calendar/reports

---

## How Daily Reset Works

### Automatic Reset (At Midnight)
When you open the app on a new day:
1. The app checks the `last_opened` date stored in SharedPreferences
2. If today's date is different from `last_opened`, it triggers the reset:
   - All daily tasks (recurring=true) are unchecked
   - All non-daily tasks (recurring=false) are deleted
   - The `last_opened` date is updated to today
   - Daily goal progress resets to 0 points

### Manual Reset (For Testing)
You can manually trigger the daily reset without waiting for midnight:

**Steps:**
1. Open the app on your phone
2. Go to **Settings** (bottom navigation)
3. Scroll down to find the **"🧪 Trigger Daily Reset (Testing)"** button
4. Tap the button
5. Confirm the action in the dialog
6. The app will:
   - Simulate the next day
   - Delete all non-daily tasks
   - Uncheck all daily tasks
   - Reset daily goal to 0 points

## What to Verify

### ✅ Daily Tasks Reset
**Before Reset:**
- Daily tasks (pm, mm, fm, em) are checked/completed
- Daily goal shows completed points

**After Reset:**
- All daily tasks are unchecked
- Daily goal shows 0 points
- Tasks are ready for the new day

### ✅ Non-Daily Tasks Deleted
**Before Reset:**
- Non-daily tasks (ps, pl, ms, ml, fs, fl, etc.) are visible
- These are tasks created for the previous day

**After Reset:**
- All non-daily tasks are removed from the task list
- Only daily tasks remain
- Task count decreases

### ✅ Daily Goal Progress Resets
**Before Reset:**
- Progress bar shows completed points from previous day
- Example: "6/12 points = 50%"

**After Reset:**
- Progress bar shows "0/12 points = 0%"
- All sections show 0% completion
- Fresh start for the new day

### ✅ Calendar History Preserved
**Important:** Completed tasks are preserved for calendar/reports
- Historical data is maintained
- Calendar shows past completion percentages
- Weekly/monthly reports include historical data

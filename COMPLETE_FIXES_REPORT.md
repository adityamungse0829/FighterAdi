## Issue #1: Task Checkbox Bug (CRITICAL) ✅ FIXED

### Problem
When clicking on one daily task, another task's checkbox was getting toggled.

### Root Cause
Widget key was using `hashCode` which changes when task properties change (completed status, completion date). This caused Flutter to lose track of which widget corresponds to which task.

### Solution
Changed widget key from `ValueKey(t.hashCode.toString() + t.title)` to `ValueKey(t.id)`

### File Changed
`lib/screens/tasks_screen.dart` - Line 532

### Verification
✅ Tested on device - tasks now toggle correctly

---

## Issue #2: Weekly Percentage Calculation ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Weekly percentage was showing only average of days with tasks.
- Example: 2 days with 83% and 72% showed as 78% (average of 2 days)
- Should show: 22.1% (average of all 7 days)

### Solution
Changed calculation to include all 7 days in the week:
```
Formula: (Day1% + Day2% + ... + Day7%) / 7
```

### File Changed
`lib/screens/calendar_screen.dart` - Lines 44-56

### Verification
✅ Tested with actual data - percentages now accurate

---

## Issue #3: Monthly Percentage Calculation ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Monthly percentage was showing only average of days with tasks.

### Solution
Changed calculation to include all days in the month:
```
Formula: (Day1% + Day2% + ... + DayN%) / TotalDaysInMonth
```

### File Changed
`lib/screens/calendar_screen.dart` - Lines 58-72

### Verification
✅ Tested with actual data - percentages now accurate

---

## Issue #4: Daily Task Reset ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### What Happens
When a new day starts (at midnight or via manual trigger):
1. All daily tasks (recurring=true) are unchecked
2. Completion dates are cleared
3. Daily goal progress resets to 0 points
4. Tasks are ready for the new day

### File Changed
`lib/screens/task_provider.dart` - Lines 126-138

### Verification
✅ Tested on device - daily tasks reset correctly

---

## Issue #5: Non-Daily Task Deletion ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### What Happens
When a new day starts:
1. All non-daily tasks from previous day are deleted
2. Only daily tasks remain
3. Historical data is preserved for calendar/reports

### File Changed
`lib/screens/task_provider.dart` - Lines 140-150

### Verification
✅ Tested on device - non-daily tasks deleted correctly

---

## Issue #6: Daily Goal Reset ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### What Happens
At start of new day:
- Progress bar shows "0/12 points = 0%"
- All sections show 0% completion
- Fresh start for the new day

### Verification
✅ Tested on device - daily goal resets to 0 points
